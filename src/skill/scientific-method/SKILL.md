# Scientific Method Framework

## When to Use
Load this skill when conducting hypothesis-driven research that requires rigorous methodology.

## The Scientific Method

### 1. Observation
- Examine existing data or phenomena
- Note patterns, anomalies, or questions
- Document initial observations with `[OBSERVATION]` marker

### 2. Question
- Formulate a specific, testable question
- Use `[OBJECTIVE]` marker to state clearly

### 3. Hypothesis
- Propose a testable explanation
- Make specific, falsifiable predictions
- Use `[HYPOTHESIS]` marker

### 4. Experiment
- Design controlled experiments
- Identify variables (independent, dependent, controlled)
- Use `[EXPERIMENT]` marker for procedures

### 5. Analysis
- Collect and analyze data
- Use statistical methods appropriately
- Use `[ANALYSIS]` marker for interpretations

### 6. Conclusion
- Accept or reject hypothesis based on evidence
- Acknowledge limitations
- Use `[CONCLUSION:confidence=X]` marker

## Best Practices

1. **Null Hypothesis**: Always consider the null hypothesis
2. **Controls**: Include appropriate control groups/conditions
3. **Sample Size**: Ensure adequate sample size for statistical power
4. **Reproducibility**: Document all steps for replication
5. **Peer Review**: Validate findings before final conclusions
